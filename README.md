# Hello World!

## Today is story time! 
Once upon a time there was a lonely unicorn princess that lived in a huge castle with her father the king. Her name was 
**Swanhild** **Odette**. She was the *most* *prettiest* unicorn that you have ever seen in the observable universe.
But no one knew of her immense beauty because her father kept her hidden inside the castle walls. 
**No one will lay a hand on my precious unicorn daughter!** he said. 

Then one day, the young knight **Johann** **Paul** **the** **Generous** went on a long stroll through the *miraculous*
forest that is close to his birth village. He passed by the town of **Uttenruthia** and even crossed the high 
**Rathsberg** on his journey. He only had three things on him, that he always carries:

- His sword
- His lyre
- And his magic amulette 

After he was walking for a while he heard the devastating sobbing of a maiden. Because of the oath he swore to protect
and help the people he started to look out for the maiden in pain. He stumbled upon the castle walls and found a hole 
in it. He *carefully* peaked through it and saw the *stunning* **Swanhild** **Odette** sitting in the corner of the 
*dark* room.
